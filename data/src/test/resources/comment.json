If just a few more people had pressed the button this wouldn&amp;#39;t be happening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not claiming I&amp;#39;m leaving. But as soon as voat can handle traffic I&amp;#39;m at least checking that place out. The Button was the last great thing Reddit has ever done and from the sounds of it they should&amp;#39;ve been listening and caring for the mods instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The timer hit the holy zero. Then reddit began to slowly implode&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
